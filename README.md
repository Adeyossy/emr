## Overview
This is an electronic medical record web app. An electronic medical record system is an integrated application that allows activity of a healthcare facility to be carried out and recorded in a digital format afforded by technology. It encompasses digitizing the records of a patient, tracking payments, synchronizing investigations and management across individuals in a team and different specialties.

This EMR is designed to be simple, intuitive (not letting the user waste time on figuring out how to use the app) and aethetically pleasing to the eye. It attempts to prove that increasing complexity in functionality does not have to lead to a complicated user interface.

## Technical Overview
This is a web application based on React, PouchDB and Cloudant. It uses Bootstrap and Bootstrap fonts. It is offline first and syncs when there is internet connection.

## Goal of the EMR
- To be able to generate medical records just by listening to the conversation between the doctor and the patient.
- To be usable across several devices, be it smartphones, tablets or PCs.
- To be offline first and not get in the way of usage without internet connection
